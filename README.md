# ResilientDB: Global-Scale Sustainable Blockchain Fabric

**[ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com/)** is a **High Throughput Yielding Permissioned Blockchain Fabric** founded by **[ExpoLab](https://expolab.org/)** at **[UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/)** in 2018. ResilientDB advocates a **system-centric** design by adopting a **multi-threaded architecture** that encompasses **deep pipelines**. Further, ResilientDB **separates** the ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows it to **process messages out-of-order**.

### Quick Facts on ResilientDB
1. ResilientDB orders client transactions through a highly optimized implementation of the  **[PBFT](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf)** [Castro and Liskov, 1998] protocol, which helps to achieve consensus among its replicas. ResilientDB also supports deploying other state-of-the-art consensus protocols *[release are planned]* such as **[GeoBFT](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p868-gupta.pdf)** [**[blog](https://blog.resilientdb.com/2023/03/07/GeoBFT.html), [released](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/releases/tag/nexres-v1.1.0)**], **[PoE](https://openproceedings.org/2021/conf/edbt/p111.pdf)**, **[RCC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00837)**, **[RingBFT](https://openproceedings.org/2022/conf/edbt/paper-73.pdf)**, **[PoC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02325)**, **[SpotLess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02118)**, **[HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069)**, and **[DAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf)**.
2. ResilientDB requires deploying at least **3f+1** replicas, where **f (f > 0)** is the maximum number of arbitrary (or malicious) replicas.
3. ResilientDB supports primary-backup architecture, which designates one of the replicas as the **primary** (replica with identifier **0**). The primary replica initiates consensus on a client transaction, while backups agree to follow a non-malicious primary.
4. ResilientDB exposes a wide range of interfaces such as a **Key-Value** store, **Smart Contracts**, **UTXO**, and **Python SDK**. Following are some of the decentralized applications (DApps) built on top of ResilientDB: **[NFT Marketplace](https://nft.resilientdb.com/)** and **[Debitable](https://debitable.resilientdb.com/)**.
5. To persist blockchain, chain state, and metadata, ResilientDB provides durability through  **LevelDB** and **RocksDB**.
6. ResilientDB provides access to a seamless **GUI display** for deployment and maintenance, and supports  **Grafana** for plotting monitoring data. 
7. **[Historial Facts]** The ResilientDB project was founded by **[Mohammad Sadoghi](https://expolab.org/)** along with his students ([Suyash Gupta](https://gupta-suyash.github.io/index.html) as the lead Architect, [Sajjad Rahnama](https://sajjadrahnama.com/), [Jelle Hellings](https://www.jhellings.nl/)) at **[UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/)** in 2018 and was open-sourced in late 2019. On September 30, 2021, we released ResilientDB v-3.0. In 2022, ResilientDB was completely re-written and re-architected ([Junchao Chen](https://github.com/cjcchen) as the lead Architect along with the entire [NexRes Team](https://resilientdb.com/)), paving the way for a new sustainable foundation, referred to as NexRes (Next Generation ResilientDB). Thus, on September 30, 2022, NexRes-v1.0.0 was born, marking a new beginning for **[ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com/)**.

## Build and Deploy ResilientDB

Next, we show how to quickly build ResilientDB and deploy 4 replicas and 1 client proxy on your local machine. The proxy acts as an interface for all the clients. It batches client requests and forwards these batches to the replica designated as the leader. The 4 replicas participate in the PBFT consensus to order and execute these batches. Post execution, they return the response to the leader.

Install dependencies:

    ./INSTALL.sh


Run ResilientDB (Providing a Key-Value Service):

    ./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh
    
- This script starts 4 replicas and 1 client. Each replica instantiates a key-value store.

Build Interactive Tools:

    bazel build service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools

Run tools to set a value by a key (for example, set the value with key "test" and value "test_value"):

    bazel-bin/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools service/tools/config/interface/service.config set test test_value
    
You will see the following result if successful:

    client set ret = 0

Run tools to get value by a key (for example, get the value with key "test"):

    bazel-bin/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools service/tools/config/interface/service.config get test 
    
You will see the following result if successful:

    client get value = test_value

Run tools to get all values that have been set:

    bazel-bin/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools service/tools/config/interface/service.config getvalues

You will see the following result if successful:

    client getvalues value = [test_value]

## Deployment Script

We also provide access to a [deployment script](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb/tree/master/scripts/deploy) that allows deployment on distinct machines.

## Deploy via Docker

1. **Install Docker**  
   Before getting started, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker already, you can download and install it from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. **Pull the Latest ResilientDB Image**  
   Choose the appropriate [ResilientDB image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/expolab/resdb/general) for your machine's architecture:

   - For amd architecture, run:
     ```shell
     docker pull expolab/resdb:amd64
     ```

   - For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) architecture, run:
     ```shell
     docker pull expolab/resdb:arm64
     ```

3. **Run a Container with the Pulled Image**  
   Launch a Docker container using the ResilientDB image you just pulled:

   - For amd architecture, run:
     ```shell
     docker run -d --name myserver expolab/resdb:amd64
     ```

   - For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) architecture, run:
     ```shell
     docker run -d --name myserver expolab/resdb:arm64
     ```

4. **Test with Set and Get Commands**
   Exec into the running server:
   ```shell
   docker exec -it myserver bash
   ```

   Verify the functionality of the service by performing set and get operations:

   - Set a test value:
   ```shell
   bazel-bin/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools service/tools/config/interface/service.config set test test_value
   ```

   - Retrieve the test value:
   ```
    bazel-bin/service/tools/kv/api_tools/kv_service_tools service/tools/config/interface/service.config get test
   ```
